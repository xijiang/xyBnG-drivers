    iiocs(test, foo, bar, lmp, ngn, trait, fixed, plan, dF, F0)
Optimal contribution selection with `IBD` relationship matrix for both EBV and
constraint on `foo`.xy and `foo`.ped in directory `test` for `ngn` generations.
SNP linkage information are in DataFrame `lmp`. The results are saved in
`bar`.xy, `bar`.ped in directory `test`. The selection is on a single trait
`trait` with fixed effects `fixed`, which is a column name vector in pedigree
DataFrame. Parents are sampled according to `plan`. The constraint Î”F is `dF`.
`F0` is the inbreeding coefficient of the `foo` population.

This function uses the TM1997 algorithm for OCS.
